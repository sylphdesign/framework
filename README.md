Framework
=========

A customizable framework for scalable, robust, front-end development. This framework includes zero visual styling. It's all about reusable CSS, semantic markup, maintainable SASS, naming conventions and CSS components. Created by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/colmtuite" target="_blank">Colm Tuite</a>.

Things to note
=========

- Zero visual style. Zilch. Nada. That's your job.
- We use 1 - 6 for sizing all elements. Not just headings. That way, all sizes are semantic and reusable.
- Function is completely separated from form.
- Most of this framework is supposed to be edited directly for customization.
